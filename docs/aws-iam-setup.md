# AWS IAM Setup


## Overview
We can give access to the users for the AWS account through a service called Identity Access Management.
Identity Access Management allows the root user of the AWS account to add any additional accounts and even police them by giving them certain access rights through policies and groups.


## Access Types
Users can either have programmatic access, which allows them to access the AWS instance through the CLI.
Additionally, users can be granted management console access, which allows them to access the AWS account through the web interface.


## Where to Login
The users that are created, can login through the following link [https://485876055632.signin.aws.amazon.com/console](https://485876055632.signin.aws.amazon.com/console)


## Change passwords
Every user initally gets assigned a auto-generated password, which they have to change at inital login.

## Access Credentials
Users also get temporary Access-Key ID's and Secret Access Key's that can be manually revoked and granted.
